abstract="We propose a method to search for a lemma in a Coq proof library by using the lemma type as a key. The method is based on the concept of type isomorphism developed within the functional programming framework. We introduce a theory which is a generalization of the axiomatization for the simply typed $\gamma$-calculus (associated with Closed Cartesian Categories) to an Extended Calculus of Constructions with a more Extensional conversion rule. We show a soundness theorem for this theory but we notice that it is not contextual and requires ``ad hoc'' contextual rules. Thus, we see how we must adapt this theory for Coq and we define an approximation of the contextual part of this theory, which is implemented in a decision procedure.",

abstract="This paper describes feature vector indexing, a new, non-perfect indexing method for clause subsumption. It is suitable for both forward (i.e., finding a subsuming clause in a set) and backward (finding all subsumed clauses in a set) subsumption. Moreover, it is easy to implement, but still yields excellent performance in practice. As an added benefit, by restricting the selection of features used in the index, our technique immediately adapts to indexing modulo arbitrary AC theories with only minor loss of efficiency. Alternatively, the feature selection can be restricted to result in set subsumption. Feature vector indexing has been implemented in our equational theorem prover E, and has enabled us to integrate new simplification techniques making heavy use of subsumption. We experimentally compare the performance of the prover for a number of strategies using feature vector indexing and conventional sequential subsumption.",
